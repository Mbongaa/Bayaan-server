# LiveKit Version Strategy - Decision Guide

## Current Situation
- **Working Version**: LiveKit Agents 1.2.1 (July 28 deployment)
- **Broken Version**: LiveKit Agents 1.2.6+ (new deployments)
- **Core Issue**: Job dispatch mechanism changed between versions

## Your Options

### Option 1: Stay on 1.2.1 (RECOMMENDED) ✅
**Why this is the best choice:**
- Your system works perfectly with 1.2.1
- No code changes needed
- Domain patch works as intended
- Immediate production stability

**How to implement:**
1. Use `requirements-pinned.txt` for all deployments
2. Keep the July 28 code exactly as is
3. Don't worry about deprecation warnings

### Option 2: Update to 1.2.6+ (Not Recommended) ❌
**Why this is problematic:**
- Requires debugging the new job dispatch mechanism
- Frontend changes needed for room creation
- Extensive testing required
- Risk of breaking production

**What would need to change:**
- Frontend room creation must explicitly request agents
- Backend job acceptance might need new parameters
- Potential LiveKit Cloud configuration changes

## The Real Problem Explained

The issue isn't your code - it's that LiveKit changed how agents connect to rooms between these versions:

**1.2.1 Behavior:**
```
Frontend creates room → LiveKit automatically dispatches to any registered agent
```

**1.2.6+ Behavior:**
```
Frontend creates room → Must explicitly request specific agent → Agent must match request criteria
```

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **For Production (Today):**
   ```bash
   # Deploy using pinned versions
   pip install -r requirements-pinned.txt
   ```

2. **Keep Your Original Code:**
   - The July 28 version with domain patch
   - TranscriptionConfig wrapper style
   - No changes needed

3. **Why This Works:**
   - LiveKit 1.2.1 is stable and battle-tested
   - Your domain patch functions correctly
   - Job dispatch works as expected

## Long-term Considerations

**If you eventually need to upgrade:**
1. Create a development branch
2. Test the new dispatch mechanism thoroughly
3. Update frontend room creation logic
4. Only deploy after extensive testing

**But for now:**
- You have a working, stable system
- No immediate need to upgrade
- Focus on your business logic, not SDK issues

## Summary

**Your July 28 code is perfect** - the only issue is version mismatch. By pinning to LiveKit 1.2.1, you get:
- ✅ Immediate working deployment
- ✅ Domain patch functionality
- ✅ Proper job dispatch
- ✅ Real-time transcription
- ✅ No code changes needed

The "newer" versions aren't necessarily "better" for your use case. Stick with what works!
